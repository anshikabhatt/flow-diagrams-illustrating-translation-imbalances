# Sankey Diagram
Using the public Content Translation data source as a reference, I wrote Python code to generate a Sankey diagram that displays the translation relationships between several languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Portuguese, Arabic, and hindi. I refined and extended the illustration to highlight additional details and intriguing imbalances or balances in translation.

#Scatter Plot Diagram
Furthermore, I attempted to create a scatter plot diagram using Python code to retrieve translation data from the Wikipedia API and visualize the number of translations between different languages. The scatter plot diagrams are based on the ratio of translations from one language to another, providing a clear visualization of the relationships between various languages.

also I attempted to create another scatterplot diagram of the translation ratio against the Wikipedia article count for different languages. However, I was unable to find a convenient source of data for this purpose. As a result, I estimated the translation ratios based on my research. It is important to note that these are rough estimates, and the actual translation ratios may vary depending on the specific topic or subject matter of the articles. Additionally, there is no way to verify the accuracy of these estimates as there is no official data available. Given these limitations, any conclusions drawn from this data should be considered with caution.

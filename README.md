# flow-diagrams-illustrating-translation-imbalances
This repository is my submisssion for the task #T331204.
Using the public, Content Translation data source and referring to the example R code, I wrote Python code to render a Sankey diagram. I refined and extended the illustration to bring out additional details, such as excluding English to see the relationships between the remaining languages, including Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Portuguese, and Arabic. overall I created a diagram of a smaller subset of languages that show intriguing imbalances or balances in translation.

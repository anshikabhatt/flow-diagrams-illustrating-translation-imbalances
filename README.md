# flow-diagrams-illustrating-translation-imbalances
This repository is my contribution to task #T331204. Using the public Content Translation data source as a reference, I wrote Python code to generate a Sankey diagram that displays the translation relationships between several languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Portuguese, Arabic, and more. I refined and extended the illustration to highlight additional details and intriguing imbalances or balances in translation.

Furthermore, I attempted to create a scatter plot diagram using Python code to retrieve translation data from the Wikipedia API and visualize the number of translations between different languages. The scatter plot diagrams are based on the ratio of translations from one language to another, providing a clear visualization of the relationships between various languages.
